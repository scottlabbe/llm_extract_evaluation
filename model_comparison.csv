8,What was the amount of error identified pharmacy expenses reported by the MCO? ,"The audit report identified that the amount of pharmacy expenses reported by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas (the Managed Care Organization) was $26.4 million. However, this amount did not reflect the final amount paid to pharmacy providers because it did not include the funds that the Pharmacy Benefit Manager calculated the pharmacy must return post-payment. The report specifically mentioned a ""reconciliation amount"" of $8.2 million that was calculated for one contract tested, indicating that the reported pharmacy expenses were overstated by this amount. Therefore, the error identified in the pharmacy expenses reported by the MCO was related to the failure to account for the returned funds, which effectively reduced the final amount retained by pharmacies.",False,0.0083226,"The audit report indicates that the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas (Health Plan) reported $26.4 million in pharmacy expenses in its fiscal year 2018 FSRs. However, this amount did not reflect the final amount paid to pharmacy providers because it did not include the impact of funds that pharmacies were required to return to the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM).

The exact amount of error could not be definitively determined due to the following reasons:

1.  **Lack of Transparency**: The PBM calculated a return of funds totaling $8.2 million for both Medicaid and non-Medicaid programs. However, the PBM combined multiple lines of business in its analysis and did not identify what portion of the calculated return of funds was specifically related to STAR Kids or its other Medicaid programs. The auditors were repeatedly denied access to the Pharmacy Benefit Manager’s complete analysis of pharmacy claims.
2.  **Health Plan's Response**: The Health Plan claims that the PBM received a lower amount of $4,147,419 as Reconciliation Amount, and Texas Medicaid represents only 0.13% of the business subject to the Reconciliation Process.
3.  **Auditor Follow-up Comment**: The auditors stand by their conclusions based on evidence provided during this audit.
