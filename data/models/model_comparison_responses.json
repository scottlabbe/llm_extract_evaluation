However, the PBM combined multiple lines of business in its analysis and did not identify what portion of the calculated return of funds was specifically related to STAR Kids or its other Medicaid programs. The auditors were repeatedly denied access to the Pharmacy Benefit Manager\u2019s complete analysis of pharmacy claims.\n2.  **Health Plan's Response**: The Health Plan claims that the PBM received a lower amount of $4,147,419 as Reconciliation Amount, and Texas Medicaid represents only 0.13% of the business subject to the Reconciliation Process.\n3.  **Auditor Follow-up Comment**: The auditors stand by their conclusions based on evidence provided during this audit.\n\nDespite the lack of exact quantification, the report indicates that pharmacy expenses were overstated due to the failure to account for returned funds, making the reported $26.4 million inaccurate.",
